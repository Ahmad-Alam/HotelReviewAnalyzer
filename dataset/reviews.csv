Our room was on the 20th floor overlooking Broadway and the madhouse of the Fairway Market. Room was quite with no noise evident from the hallway or adjoining rooms. It was great to be able to open windows when we craved fresh rather than heated air. The beds, including the fold out sofa bed, were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned well. Wi-fi access worked like a dream with only one connectivity issue on our first night and this was promptly responded to with a call from the service provider to ensure that all was well. The location close to the 72nd Street subway station is great and the complimentary umbrellas on the drizzly days were greatly appreciated. It is fabulous to have the kitchen with cooking facilities and the access to a whole range of fresh foods directly across the road at Fairway.
This is the second time that members of the party have stayed at the Beacon and it will certainly be our hotel of choice for future visits.","{'username': 'Papa_Panda', 'num_cities': 22, 'num_helpful_votes': 12, 'num_reviews': 29, 'num_type_reviews': 24, 'id': '8C0B42FF3C0FA366A21CFD785302A032', 'location': 'Gold Coast'}",December 2012,93338,0,2012-12-17,147643103,False

The Hyatt has come up with a modern hotel that is both comfortable and convenient. When you arrive you are greeted by friendly ""Hosts"" and they walk you to the check-in desk while offering you a beverage. 
We had a one bedroom suite that accommodated four people reasonably well. Plenty of closet space, well lit with floor to ceiling windows, and actually quiet!
The bathroom was large with a very nice walk-in shower and a built-in bench with unique low spout to wash your feet.
The kitchenette was a nice touch with a stocked fridge offering complimentary non-alcoholic beverages and snacks, dishes and utensils, a sink, dishwasher, and a microwave. 
They have daily Happy Hour(s) where you can get a complimentary decent glass of wine in the modest Lobby Lounge and bring it to your room. The Lobby Lounge has some seating and one table with 8 or so chairs where you can buy food from the adjacent restaurant. One suggestion is to offer selections of cheese and crackers platters to go with that wine. We ordered one that had to be custom made, but it worked well. 
We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants. The restaurant off the lobby was very pricey for breakfast (+$20 per entree). When you can get a decent breakfast within a block or two of the hotel for under $10, what can I say?

MUCH better than the West Hollywood property where Brand standards are slowly fading. This is the shining star here in the States.
My room (suite) on the 12th floor was fantastic as usual. Perfectly maintained, very comfortable, great bathrooms (best in NYC???). The bathroom is huge, with large shower 'room' and multiple shower heads. Double lavatories flank one wall. Huge....
THe bed is always perfect. Televisions in both rooms were perfect for my limited time spend in the suite. Nice desk for work area and in room dining. 
Every room has a fridge with complimentary soft drinks, snacks, water, sparkling water, milk and juices. Nice touch. Suite has full size refrigerator with icemaker, and also features a microwave, sink and dishwasher drawer....all nicely concealed behind beautiful cabinetry. Really great for a longer stay...
I do have 2 complaints. First, the elevators. The waits were sometimes ridiculous. 3 elevators serve the main tower with a rather limited number of rooms. THis is a newer hotel, but there is no service elevator. I was continually surprised after waiting for an elevator at how many stops we made for housekeeping to enter with carts, room service carts and trays, etc. How could Hyatt skip a service elevator on this new property? It really stinks at times.....its bad.
Lastly, i have traveled with world and certainly know NYC pricing. Breakfast at the Andaz ranks above almost anything i have ever paid. Apparently, i had a $190.00 breakfast for two the first morning, and $175.00 the second. Eggs for each, coffee, berries. Wow. Of course, i really don't know...as there is no bill. They just deliver it, and leave. Prices are listed in the in-suite menu, but no itemized billing is given. I am 'gifted' with a $75.00 credit for my breakfast as a Diamond member, and i assumed that had not been applied when my bill reflected a 'non itemized' charge for $110 plus for the first night, and slightly less for the second. I was wrong, it had been applied (no way for me to see this). WOW. It certainly isn't worth it.
I know i sound like one of those guys who complains about pricing, but clearly doesn't know what things cost. Wrong. This one really surprised me, and i have traveled the world for more than 20 years staying in some of the finest hotels in the world. Andaz is great, but it doesn't rank with many that i have had the pleasure of staying with.
I just had breakfast this morning for 2 at the Four Seasons NYC. It was half the cost....almost. :)
Stay away from room service in my opinion....","{'username': 'JamesE339', 'num_cities': 34, 'num_helpful_votes': 65, 'num_reviews': 104, 'num_type_reviews': 49, 'id': 'BA524A238B1171206691A6CC3F28F266', 'location': 'Saint Louis, Missouri'}",December 2012,1762573,0,2012-12-17,147612823,False

Honestly will have trouble staying at any other hotel in the NYC area. Room service was superb. One of our family members forgot their toothbrush. We called downstairs and within 3 minutes, we had four.

We fell in love with the decor. It is just like the photos in the hotel website. The lobby smelled lovely with their signature scent. It was even lovelier when mixed with the fresh coffee smell in the morning. 
Beds were extremely comfortable. Books in the room were a nice touch. We had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot. The bathrooms were really very chic and the TOTO toilets were something! 
The housekeeping service was really good with turn-down service.
We had drinks at the Lambs Club bar nearly every night with our friends and were very happy with everything. We had dinner at the Lambs Club restaurant downstairs and were very pleased. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there are a lot of alternatives close by.
My husband had a couple of pre-arranged deliveries and the concierge were very helpful with them. We thank Mr Mullins for all his help. We never saw our butler during our 9 night stay, therefore I cannot comment on the butler service, but we did not really need it anyway.

Lovely bathrooms (although they need a hand towel holder), but really comfortable. We are a family of 3 so the kiddo slept on the pull-out sofa.

We had quite a bit of luggage and no one was around to open the door at the entrance (which consists of 2 black doors that are also not marked. We wandered around a bit before realizing this WAS the main entrance)!! We needed to get a cab to the train station and were told that none were available and that we should try and walk to Madison Ave to get one! No easy feat with lots of luggage and it was quite the walk. Clearly they should have the means to summon a cab. Hopefully this will be addressed before our next visit!,"{'username': 'Reba G', 'num_reviews': 2, 'id': 'B20F8339DA7EEBDE0D00D17B3889A49B', 'location': 'Philadelphia, Pennsylvania', 'num_helpful_votes': 2}",December 2012,1762573,0,2012-12-16,147577025,False

Went with my adult daughter and we stayed in a corner room with two twin beds on the ninth floor. It's tough to find good hotels with two beds in a room in NYC so this was a bonus. The room was very quiet. I could not hear anyone from other rooms, the hallway or any street noise. The room has a sleek modern design and was spacious for NYC standards. I loved the bathroom. Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great and snacks in the rooms was a nice touch.
I also loved the overall vibe of the hotel; small, hip, clean, and friendly. Great artwork. Not warm and cozy though. The seating in the ""lobby"" is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was young and not as experienced as one would find at a five-star hotel but this is not a five-star hotel. They did the best they could to help with restaurant reservations, shopping information and other general information. Easy walk from here to Grand Central Station to hop the subway and cabs easy to find. Loved being across from The New York Pubic Library and Bryant Park. Lovely pop-up stores and ice skating in Bryant Park for the holidays. Beats the craziness of Rockefeller Center in my book. 
There are a few problems that I believe can be corrected easily. One is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. It is very dark and would be really difficult if you were trying to get ready for a special event. Also there is no drawer space and the closet is minuscule. Not sure how to correct that issue. The other problem is that the beds, at least the twins we slept in, were not very comfortable. Very firm which is fine if you like it that way. All in all though, my memories are of a great stay.","{'username': 'beachlsr', 'num_cities': 5, 'num_helpful_votes': 1, 'num_reviews': 9, 'num_type_reviews': 4, 'id': '851AD5B3B4127850A9292129C156D704', 'location': 'Hilton Head'}",December 2012,1762573,0,2012-12-16,147561287,False

Not only is the 5th Avenue property in a great location, but the rooms are wonderfully designed and well appointed and the staff does a great job in terms of customer service. My wife and I arrived at 10am on a Saturday morning and the hotel had been sold out the night before. However, the young lady checked us in quickly and asked for a phone number to call us when our room was ready. We went out to have breakfast and before we were finished she call to let me know that the room was ready. We also loved the complimentary snacks and beverages in the mini frig, as well as in the lounge. The only drawback is that the Internet is painstakingly slow, which is the reaso for the 4 stars. Except for that, the hotel is a 5 all around. Would definitely recommend highly.","{'username': 'romadaro', 'num_cities': 70, 'num_helpful_votes': 156, 'num_reviews': 103, 'num_type_reviews': 85, 'id': 'C81AB7D49D98FA410EA191E15F427BEC', 'location': 'Washington, DC'}",December 2012,1762573,5,2012-12-16,147531970,False
